Impressum Generator

== Description ==

The Impressum Manager allows the user to generate the Impressum ( Legal Imprint )
automatically and to manage it later on with only a few clicks.
At the moment the imprint is available only in German. Others can follow.

The Impressum contains a privacy policy, disclaimer, contact fields and some more stuff.
The Impressum Manager collects every name of the creator of an image by inserting the name
in the name credit field in the image interface. Then the Manager sums up the names in the
image sources so it is not necessary to write down every name of each image.
The manager will do this automatically.

Another option is to have the email represented by an image. This will reduce the
spam mails by parsing the website through a bot.
